# TODO

This captures some of the tasks to be done. The intention is to keep it updated, but may not happen. Feel free to make suggestions here.


* Security code - enhance the code generation to handle different security schemas. Currently, it only handles an API key.
* Different media types - effectively, everything is assumed to be `application/json`. Should provide better ways of uploading/downloading files.
* Hide deprecated parameters/properties
* Improve deprecation to use `x-deprecated` value in warning
* Additional examples - helps with diversity of OAS methods
